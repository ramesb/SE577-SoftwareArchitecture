#What is Token Authentication ?
> Systems and visitors will verify credentials just once. In return, they'll get a token that allows access for a time period you define.
> The approach is different from traditional user/password approach.

#How does it work
>The process works in 4 steps:
>Request: The person asks for access to a server or protected resource. That could involve a login with a password, or it could involve some other process you specify.
>Verification: The server determines that the person should have access. That could involve checking the password against the username, or it could involve another process you specify.
>Tokens: The server communicates with the authentication device, like a ring, key, phone, or similar device. After verification, the server issues a token and passes it to the user.
>Storage: The token sits within the user's browser while work continues.
